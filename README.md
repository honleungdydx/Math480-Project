Topic 1:
Investigate this challenge problem: given a binary integer a, define an operation to be: add a any number of + signs between any two digits of a, and compute the sum. It's clear given any number, finitely many operations will change this number a to 1. Now the question is: How many operations do you need at most? An example: a = 100111011 -> 100+1+1+10+11 = 1011 -> 10+1+1 = 100 -> 1+0+0 = 1 Goal: give an absolute constant C, such that for any number a, there exists a sequence of at most C operations, changing a to 1.

Topic 2: 
Find out the best algorithm to solve the famous Fermat-Torricelli problem with weights. We have three methods in hand. This project is to investigate them.
